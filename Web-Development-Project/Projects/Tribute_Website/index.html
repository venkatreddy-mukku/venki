                    Bhagat Singh (27 September 1907 - 23 March 1931) was a charismatic
                    Indian revolutionary who participated in the mistaken murder of a
                    junior British police officer in what was to be retaliation for the
                    death of an Indian nationalist. He later took part in a largely
                    symbolic bombing of the Central Legislative Assembly in Delhi and a
                    hunger strike in jail, which—on the back of sympathetic coverage in
                    Indian-owned newspapers—turned him into a household name in the
                    Punjab region, and after his execution at age 23 into a martyr and
                    folk hero in Northern India. Borrowing ideas from Bolshevism and
                    anarchism, he electrified a growing militancy in India in the 1930s,
                    and prompted urgent introspection within the Indian National
                    Congress's nonviolent but eventually successful campaign for India's
                    independence. <br /><br />

                    In December 1928, Bhagat Singh and an associate, Shivaram Rajguru,
                    both members of a small revolutionary group, the Hindustan Socialist
                    Republican Association (also Army, or HSRA), shot dead a 21-year-old
                    British police officer, John Saunders, in Lahore, Punjab, in what is
                    today Pakistan, mistaking Saunders, who was still on probation, for
                    the British senior police superintendent, James Scott, whom they had
                    intended to assassinate. They held Scott responsible for the death
                    of a popular Indian nationalist leader Lala Lajpat Rai for having
                    ordered a lathi (baton) charge in which Rai was injured and two
                    weeks thereafter died of a heart attack. As Saunders exited a police
                    station on a motorcycle, he was felled by a single bullet fired from
                    across the street by Rajguru, a marksman. As he lay injured, he was
                    shot at close range several times by Singh, the postmortem report
                    showing eight bullet wounds. Another associate of Singh, Chandra
                    Shekhar Azad, shot dead an Indian police head constable, Channan
                    Singh, who attempted to give chase as Singh and Rajguru fled
